spec:
  description: |
    cat-readme takes a git repository and
    prints the README.md file from main branch. This is an example
    Task demonstrating the following:
      - Using the git-clone catalog StepAction to clone a main branch for the repo which uses custom CAs for HTTPS
      - Passing a cloned repo to subsequent StepActions using a Workspace.
        git-clone completes before we try to read from the Workspace.
      - Using a volumeClaimTemplate Volume as a Workspace.
      - Avoiding hard-coded paths by using a Workspace's path
        variable instead.
  params:
  - name: repo-url

    description: The git repository URL to clone from.
  workspaces:

      This workspace will receive the cloned git repo and be passed
      to the next Step for the repo's README.md file to be read.
  - name: ssl-ca-dir
    description: |
      This workspace contains CA certificates, this will be used by Git to
      verify the peer with when fetching or pushing over HTTPS.
