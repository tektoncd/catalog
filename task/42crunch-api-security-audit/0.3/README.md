# 42Crunch REST API Static Security Testing

The REST API Static Security Testing task performs a static analysis of the OpenAPI definitions that includes more than 300
checks on best practices and potential vulnerabilities on how the API defines authentication, authorization, transport,
and data coming in and going out.

## Install the Task

Install `42crunch-api-security-audit` task:

```
kubectl apply -f https://api.hub.tekton.dev/v1/resource/tekton/task/42crunch-api-security-audit/0.3/raw
```

## Prerequisites

Create an API token in 42Crunch Platform and store it in a secret.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: 42crunch-api-token
type: Opaque
data:
  X42C_API_TOKEN: "{{BASE64 encoded 42Crunch API Token}}"
```

Save the above YAML to a file called `secret.yaml` inserting encoded token and run `kubectl apply -f secret.yaml` to create the secret.

This task uses Docker image for 42Crunch REST API Static Security Testing which is documented here: https://docs.42crunch.com/latest/content/tasks/integrate_audit_docker_image.htm
