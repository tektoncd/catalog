    Release a project acquired using Boskos.

    The boskos-release Task will release the specified resource from the boskos instance
    at server-url. It also assumes the resource was obtained via boskos-acquire and so
    terminates the heartbeat pod that was created by that Task to keep the resource obtained.
    It will mark the resource as dirty so that the boskos Janitor will clean it (by deleting
    any state created).
  params:
  - name: server-url
    description: The URL of the running boskos server
    default: "http://boskos.test-pods.svc.cluster.local"
  - name: leased-resource
    description: A string that identifies the leased resource to release.
  - name: owner-name
    description: A string that identifies the owner of the leased resource to request.
