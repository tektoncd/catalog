  "Body": "> Looks good to me, question though : right now it's up to the user to write github status or not right (with this PR) ? Do we envision some \"automation\" around that ?\r\n\r\nYup! Great question, I'd love to source more ideas around this. The straight-forward answer would be to provide a runner binary that would wrap test execution and transform status codes and stdout/stderr to the pull request object.\r\n\r\nIs there any work being done around passing state between TaskRuns (e.g. for conditional execution or something similar)?",
