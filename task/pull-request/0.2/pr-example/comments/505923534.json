  "Body": "> @dibyom Don't need to write more data, but it would be useful to expose it to TaskRuns to have a binary look for this information and automatically prep PR output as a response. Can you link me to that data and how TaskRuns can access it?\r\n\r\nWIP but its a file (`pr-metadata.json`) in `/workspace` for condition containers ([sample](https://gist.github.com/dibyom/95031ac458455ca2b0c25206b7420f24))\r\n\r\nIts exposed to conditional pods at the moment and not regular taskruns. I opened https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/issues/1016 to track that.",
