  "Body": "> Yeah, I think the automated use-cases for this would fit into something around either \"notification\" or \"conditional execution\".\r\n\r\nThis could be implemented with the CloudEventPipelineResource as well. \r\nThe setup would be:\r\n- each task that needs to publish test results to the PR has an output resource of type cloudevent, which is sent to a dedicated tekton listener. The TaskRun, including status, is sent as body of the cloudevent.\r\n- an event binding is defined that accepts TaskRun completion events, and triggers a GitHub PR update Task(Run)\r\n- The GitHub PR update taskrun uses the PullRequest resource as input and output, and the metadata in the TaskRun (passed as parameter to the Task) to update GitHub\r\n\r\nThe advantages of using a separate Task/TaskRun are:\r\n- The status of the original Task is not affected by the outcome of the PR update\r\n- It doesn't require conditional execution\r\n- The Task that updates GitHub PRs can be as isolated as we want from the Task that runs the tests, which should make it easier to avoid leaking the GitHub token in logs.",
