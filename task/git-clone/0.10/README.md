# `git-clone`

**Note: this Task is only compatible with Tekton Pipelines versions 0.38.0 and greater!**

**Note: this Task is not backwards compatible with the previous versions as it is now run as a non-root user!**

This `Task` has two required inputs:

1. The URL of a git repo to clone provided with the `url` param.
2. A Workspace called `output`.

The `git-clone` `Task` will clone a repo from the provided `url` into the
`output` Workspace. By default the repo will be cloned into the root of
your Workspace. You can clone into a subdirectory by setting this `Task`'s
`subdirectory` param. If the directory where the repo will be cloned is
already populated then by default the contents will be deleted before the
clone takes place. This behaviour can be disabled by setting the
`deleteExisting` param to `"false"`.

**Note**: The `git-clone` Task is run as nonroot. The files cloned on to the `output`
workspace will end up owned by user 65532.

## Workspaces

**Note**: This task is run as a non-root user with UID 65532 and GID 65532.
Generally, the default permissions for storage volumes are configured for the
root user. To make the volumes accessible by the non-root user, you will need
to either configure the permissions manually or set the `fsGroup` field under
`PodSecurityContext` in your TaskRun or PipelineRun.

An example PipelineRun will look like:
```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  generateName: git-clone-
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: git-clone-pipeline
  podTemplate:
    securityContext:
      fsGroup: 65532
...
...
```

An example TaskRun will look like:
```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: taskrun
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: git-clone
  podTemplate:
    securityContext:
      fsGroup: 65532
...
...
```

* **output**: A workspace for this Task to fetch the git repository in to.
* **ssh-directory**: An optional workspace to provide SSH credentials. At
  minimum this should include a private key but can also include other common
  files from `.ssh` including `config` and `known_hosts`. It is **strongly**
  recommended that this workspace be bound to a Kubernetes `Secret`.

* **ssl-ca-directory**: An optional workspace to provide custom CA certificates.
  Like the /etc/ssl/certs path this directory can have any pem or cert files,
  this uses libcurl ssl capath directive. See this SO answer here
  https://stackoverflow.com/a/9880236 on how it works.

* **basic-auth**: An optional workspace containing `.gitconfig` and
  `.git-credentials` files. This allows username/password/access token to be
  provided for basic auth.

  It is **strongly** recommended that this workspace be bound to a Kubernetes
  `Secret`. For details on the correct format of the files in this Workspace
  see [Using basic-auth Credentials](#using-basic-auth-credentials) below.

  **Note**: Settings provided as part of a `.gitconfig` file can affect the
  execution of `git` in ways that conflict with the parameters of this Task.
  For example, specifying proxy settings in `.gitconfig` could conflict with
  the `httpProxy` and `httpsProxy` parameters this Task provides. Nothing
  prevents you setting these parameters but it is not advised.

## Parameters

## Results

* **commit**: The precise commit SHA that was fetched by this Task
* **url**: The precise URL that was fetched by this Task

## Platforms

The Task can be run on `linux/amd64`, `linux/s390x`, `linux/arm64`, and `linux/ppc64le` platforms.

## Usage

If the `revision` is not provided in the param of the taskrun
then it will auto-detect the branch as specified by the `default`
in the respective git repository.

The following pipelines demonstrate usage of the git-clone Task:

- [Cloning a branch](./samples/git-clone-checking-out-a-branch.yaml)
- [Checking out a specific git commit](./samples/git-clone-checking-out-a-commit.yaml)
- [Checking out a git tag and using the "commit" Task Result](./samples/using-git-clone-result.yaml)

## Cloning Private Repositories

This Task supports fetching private repositories. There are three ways to
authenticate:

1. The simplest approach is to bind an `ssh-directory` workspace to this
Task. The workspace should contain private keys (e.g. `id_rsa`), `config`
and `known_hosts` files - anything you need to interact with your git remote
via SSH. It's **strongly** recommended that you use Kubernetes `Secrets` to
hold your credentials and bind to this workspace.

    In a TaskRun that would look something like this:

    ```yaml
    kind: TaskRun
    spec:
      workspaces:
      - name: ssh-directory
        secret:
          secretName: my-ssh-credentials
    ```

    And in a Pipeline and PipelineRun it would look like this:

    ```yaml
    kind: Pipeline
    spec:
      workspaces:
      - name: ssh-creds
      # ...
      tasks:
      - name: fetch-source
        taskRef:
          name: git-clone
        workspaces:
        - name: ssh-directory
          workspace: ssh-creds
      # ...
    ---
    kind: PipelineRun
    spec:
      workspaces:
      - name: ssh-creds
        secret:
          secretName: my-ssh-credentials
      # ...
    ```

    The `Secret` would appear the same in both cases - structured like a `.ssh`
    directory:

    ```yaml
    kind: Secret
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: my-ssh-credentials
    data:
      id_rsa: # ... base64-encoded private key ...
      known_hosts: # ... base64-encoded known_hosts file ...
      config: # ... base64-encoded ssh config file ...
    ```

    Including `known_hosts` is optional but strongly recommended. Without it
    the `git-clone` Task will blindly accept the remote server's identity.

2. Use Tekton Pipelines' built-in credentials support as [documented in
Pipelines' auth.md](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/auth.md).

3. Another approach is to bind an `ssl-ca-directory` workspace to this
Task. The workspace should contain crt keys (e.g. `ca-bundle.crt`)files - anything you need to interact with your git remote
via custom CA . It's **strongly** recommended that you use Kubernetes `Secrets` to
hold your credentials and bind to this workspace.

    In a TaskRun that would look something like this:

    ```yaml
    kind: TaskRun
    spec:
      workspaces:
      - name: ssl-ca-directory
        secret:
          secretName: my-ssl-credentials
    ```

    And in a Pipeline and PipelineRun it would look like this:

    ```yaml
    kind: Pipeline
    spec:
      workspaces:
      - name: ssl-creds
      # ...
      tasks:
      - name: fetch-source
        taskRef:
          name: git-clone
        workspaces:
        - name: ssl-ca-directory
          workspace: ssl-creds
      # ...
    ---
    kind: PipelineRun
    spec:
      workspaces:
      - name: ssl-creds
        secret:
          secretName: my-ssl-credentials
      # ...
    ```

    The `Secret` would appear like below:

    ```yaml
    kind: Secret
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: my-ssl-credentials
    data:
      ca-bundle.crt: # ... base64-encoded crt ...  # If key/filename is other than ca-bundle.crt then set crtFileName param as explained under Parameters section
    ```

## Using basic-auth Credentials

**Note**: It is strongly advised that you use `ssh` credentials when the option
is available to you before using basic auth. You can generate a short
lived token from WebVCS platforms (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket etc..) to be used
as a password and generally be able to use `git` as the username.
On bitbucket server the token may have a / into it so you would need
to urlquote them before in the `Secret`, see this stackoverflow answer :

https://stackoverflow.com/a/24719496 

To support basic-auth this Task exposes an optional `basic-auth` Workspace.
The bound Workspace must contain a `.gitconfig` and `.git-credentials` file.
Any other files on this Workspace are ignored. A typical `Secret` containing
these credentials looks as follows:

```yaml
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-basic-auth-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  .gitconfig: |
    [credential "https://<hostname>"]
      helper = store
  .git-credentials: |
    https://<user>:<pass>@<hostname>
```
