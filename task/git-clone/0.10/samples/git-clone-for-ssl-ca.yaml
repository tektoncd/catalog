metadata:

spec:
  description: |
    cat-readme takes a git repository and
    prints the README.md file from main branch. This is an example
    Pipeline demonstrating the following:
      - Using the git-clone catalog Task to clone a main branch for the repo which uses custom CAs for HTTPS
      - Passing a cloned repo to subsequent Tasks using a Workspace.
      - Ordering Tasks in a Pipeline using "runAfter" so that
        git-clone completes before we try to read from the Workspace.
      - Using a volumeClaimTemplate Volume as a Workspace.
      - Avoiding hard-coded paths by using a Workspace's path
        variable instead.
