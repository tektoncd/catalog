metadata:

  description: |
    cat-branch-readme takes a git repository and a branch name and
    prints the README.md file from that branch. This is an example
    Pipeline demonstrating the following:
      - Using the git-clone catalog Task to clone a branch
      - Passing a cloned repo to subsequent Tasks using a Workspace.
      - Ordering Tasks in a Pipeline using "runAfter" so that
        git-clone completes before we try to read from the Workspace.
      - Using a volumeClaimTemplate Volume as a Workspace.
      - Avoiding hard-coded paths by using a Workspace's path
        variable instead.

      This workspace will receive the cloned git repo and be passed
      to the next Task for the repo's README.md file to be read.
