kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: sparse-checkout-list-dir
spec:
  description: |
    sparse-checkout-list-dir takes a git repository and a list of
    directory patterns to match and lists all cloned files and directories.
    This is an example pipeline demonstrating the following:
      - Using the git-clone catalog Task to clone a specific set of
        files based on directory patterns.
      - Passing a cloned repo to subsequent Tasks using a Workspace.
      - Ordering Tasks in a Pipeline using "runAfter" so that
        git-clone completes before we try to read from the Workspace.
      - Using a volumeClaimTemplate Volume as a Workspace.
      - Avoiding hard-coded paths by using a Workspace's path
        variable instead.
